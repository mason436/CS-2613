# CS 2613 Lab 8: Our Final Lab using the Programming Language Racket 

As usual, we had some pre-lab work from the end of previous lab, which was asking us to read through [section 6](https://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/FICS/Functional_Abstraction.html), and to read up on [signatures](https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/advanced.html#%28part._advanced-signatures%29)

For our eighth lab in CS 2613, we start off with a class discussion on whether we had any questions or concerns with the upcoming Assignment 2. We then created a *L08* folder within our local repository to be used a work space for the class, and to be pushed to our CourseGit at the end of the lab. 

Today marks our final lab using the programming language Racket.

*Phew*

While it has been fun, and an interesting challenge of learning Racket over the last 8 labs, I am overall excited to be moving on. Racket is an interesting language and I have learnt new skills and new approaches to coding, but I believe that both Python and JavaScript will be more beneficial to me within my career after leaving the university. Racket was quite new to me, with its rather unique syntax and IDE, but I still enjoyed learning it overall. Next week, JavaScript !!

We then formed groups of 2 to 3 to work on [exercise 27](https://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/FICS/Functional_Abstraction.html#%28part._.Still_more_functional_abstraction%29) from the class text *A Functional Introduction To Computer Science*.  Exercise 27 challenged us to use the new, to us, functions of *foldr* and *lambda*. These skills will be necessary to use in our upcoming assignment 2. 

We then starting working on exercise 29 from the class text FICS. This exercise has us working with foldr, functional_abstractions, and furthered our skills on lists within Racket. We then completed exercise 28 from the FICS text 

This lab we were still working with the familiar skills of lists, but started working with foldr and lambda, which are both completely new concepts to me.  I found this lab difficult to grasp fully, but I plan to work on it more within my own time this weekend.  I found the use of lambda a bit odd/ convoluted, but it's possible I just haven't fully grasped the concept. I am very excited to finish up with Racket and start with JavaScript in Lab 9 next Monday.
We were asked to read up on values, types and operators before next lab, which is an introduction to JavaScript.
