# CS 2613 Lab 9: Starting in JavaScript

Today marks the first day that we are coding in JavaScript! After spending a good amount of class time on learning Racket, we are moving on to the second language (of four) that we will be learning in this course. I am excited to be moving on, as much as I did find racket new and a good challenge. I think JavaScript will be of more use to me in my career, and learning coding skills to be used in my career after school is a big reason that I elected to take this course.

We were given pre-lab work of watching this [video](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) , and read these articles; [Values, Types and Operators](http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html) and [Defining a Function](https://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html#h_tqLFw/oazr). These were given to us 
We were also asked to answer the following questions:
- How is assignment (=) in javascript different from binding (let, define) in Racket?

- *return* is mandatory. What does it mean?

- what is the difference between the two kinds of anonymous functions in JavaScript? Hint: the first example is an *arrow function*.
